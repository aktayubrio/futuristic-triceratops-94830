> **1.Mindset :**

>
> As mentioned in my previous article ,'Trading is more about psychology than finance'.
> Every profitable trader do not have a MBA degree from Harvard and it is not even required in fact
> many of them are dropouts, here the only thing that matters is your own skillset and most
> importantly the mindset. When you start trading at first and win a few trades initially or lose few
> trades you become overwhelmed or depressed and miss out on the most important thing
> ‘learning’. It is not only your winning trades or losing trades that define you as a good or a bad
> trader because if you evaluate you trades on a daily basis irrespective if it being profitable trade or
> a loss ultimately you are developing yourself just like professional traders do. Professional traders
> do not have any any secret apart from their learnings. The mindset of a pro trader is always
> focused on the learnings because they know that in long term their learnings will always make
> them profitable overall.
>
> **2.Continuous learning :**

> ‘A fool thinks himself to be wise, but a wise man knows himself to be a fool’-: These words were

> always reminds himself that market has its own ways to teach no matter how profitable he has
> been in the past all of it can be lost in a day in addition to that market is dynamic in nature in the
> sense that the strategies or trading setups that were profitable in the past may not be profitable
> today. Hence it is very important to make learning as a habit to stay at par with the market
> sentiments and keep developing the trading strategies when they start to backfire.

> **3.Risk Management :**

> It is a classic old saying that while you invest always remember that Rome was not built in a day and
> while you trade always remember that Hiroshima was destroyed in a day. No matter how good a
> setup is stop-loss is a must in addition to that never risk 2% of you capital in a single trade.
> Moreover if you are not able to understand the market movement at any trading day the best
> thing to do is stay away from the screen. Always remember ‘choosing not to trade is also a trade’.

> **4.Trading journal :**

> It is a must in order to evaluate you trading, best idea is to keep a rough notebook and write
> whatever comes to you mind while you trade and fair it later to evaluate why you entered the trade
> and whether you logic was correct or not. This process helps in a lot of ways if you make it a habit
> to maintain a trading journal where you write your profit and losses and side by side you thoughts
> and having done this continuously compare the past thoughts to the latest one’s and you will
> notice the difference in the way you think while you trade.
>
> **5.Trading setup :**
>

>
> A professional trading setup does not means more winning rate its a common notion that in order
> to remain profitable the winning trades should be more but it is subjective in nature : Let’s take an
> example where we have setup A and B .
>
> \- In setup A risk to reward is 1:1 and hence in order to stay profitable the trader needs a winning
> rate of 50% .
>
> \- In setup B risk to reward is 1:3 and hence the trader needs a winning rate of 25%.
>
> So it is a must to evaluate your trading setup thoroughly and backtest the setup keeping a sample
> size of at least 10 trades to be on a safer side.
>
> *   **Conclusion :** The Diference between the amateur and a professioanl trader is nothing but the will of the latter to succeed and treat trading as a skill which is improvised over and over again.
